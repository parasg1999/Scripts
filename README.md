# Scripts

This repository contains some of the scripts that I used as an Ubuntu i3wm user.
1. **Battery script:** Normal Ubuntu with GNOME generally notifies in case the battery is low, but in my case where I used i3wm, 
this script would poll battery health, and send a notification to charge.

2. **Class:** During the 8th semester, which was held in an online mode, this script would open the meet link of the class that was currently taking place,
saving the hassle to manage a dozen links.
